# potato-diary
I'm gonna make a routine to record my daily diary.

I'd graduated from the Electronic Engineering and worked for a Process Optimization AI Company for 2 years.
I wanted to quit my job and spend some time focusing on relaxation and self-improvement, but it didn't work out because of my health and laziness. 
And now I'm having a hard time finding a job because of the heavy job shortage.

These days I'm spending many times feeling inactive, uneasy, depressive and feeling like I'm useless myself.
I think I'm pathetic because I haven't done anything for almost a year since I've been off work.

I could write this kind of record in a personal space, but I decided to post it publicly, hoping that if someone is like me, they can get empathy and consolation.
Also, I've thought of Github as a very productive place, where people visit when they're working hard and being their best selves. 
So, I feel like writing a daily journal here could help boost my self-esteem, even if it's just about small, ordinary things.
